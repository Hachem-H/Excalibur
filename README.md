# Excalibur
A deadly piece of software

## OpenGL Support for Legacy and Virtual Machines
To enable older machines and virtual machines without a modern OpenGL version, you can copy the `opengl32.dll` file from the`Vendor/` folder and paste it into the installation directory (usually located at `C:\Program Files\Excalibur`). By doing so, you ensure that the required `opengl32.dll` file is present in the installation directory, enabling the application to function correctly on these machines.

*_The `opengl32.dll` is provided by Mesa3D_
